## How to Contribute

Pull Requests (PRs) are the main and exclusive way to contribute to the code-annotation project.
In order for a PR to be accepted it needs to pass a list of requirements:

* If the PR is a bug fix, it has to include a new unit test that fails before the patch is merged.
* If the PR is a new feature, it has to come with a suite of unit tests, that tests the new functionality.
* In any case, all the PRs have to pass the personal evaluation of at least one of the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS) of code-annotation project.

### Format of the commit message

Every commit message should describe what was changed, under which context and, if applicable, the GitHub issue it relates to:

```
plumbing: packp, Skip argument validations for unknown capabilities. Fixes #623
```

## Development

For convenience, you can create a `.env` file with all the environment variables described in the [README](./README.md). A template with a sample configuration suitable for development is provided in `.env.tpl`. You can copy it to `.env` and set up the variables there.

_Note_: you will working GitHub OAuth credentials to run the application in development mode, either by setting the environment variables, or through the `.env` file. In order to be able to use this application while running the tool locally, make sure you use `http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth-callback` as the "Authorization callback URL". Please follow the [README Installation section](./README.md#installation) for instructions on how to do it.

### Global dependencies

You should already have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install#install), and properly [configured the $GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)

```
go version; # prints your go version
echo $GOPATH; # prints your $GOPATH path
```

The project must be under $GOPATH, as required by the Go tooling.
You should be able to navigate into the source code by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/src-d/code-annotation
```

You need also [Yarn v1.x.x installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```
yarn --version; # prints your Yarn version
```

## Installation

You need to satisfy all [project requirements](#requirements), and then run:

```bash
$ go get -d -u github.com/src-d/code-annotation/...
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/src-d/code-annotation
$ make serve
```

This will start a server locally, which you can access on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Frontend:

If you want to benefit from frontend hot reloading feature:

Run server. Execute:

```bash
$ make gorun
```

And then run frontend in dev mode. Execute:

```bash
$ make dev-frontend
```

### Backend:

Shortcut to run `go run` with environment variables

```bash
$ make gorun
```
